# IRIS Pro: 智能主题过滤检索系统

### 📋 项目概览
本项目为《信息检索》课程设计（Topic 2）。系统实现了从**用户查询意图识别**到**混合检索**的完整闭环。

### 🚀 核心技术点
* **意图分类**: 使用 **BERT (bert-base-uncased)** 对用户 Query 进行 20 类语义分类。
* **混合检索**: 融合了基于 **Elasticsearch (BM25)** 的关键词检索与基于 **FAISS (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** 的语义向量检索。
* **重排序算法**: 使用 **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** 算法对两种检索结果进行加权融合。

### 📦 运行说明
1.  **后端**: 核心算法实现在 `text_classification_retrieval_system.py` 中。
2.  **前端**: 交互界面采用 React 开发，实时展示分类置信度与检索得分。
3.  **部署**: 本仓库演示了前端交互逻辑，真实算法环境需依赖本地 Elasticsearch 集群。
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
